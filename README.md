## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – layout and styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – state management, drag & drop, storage

No frameworks. No libraries. No backend.

---

## Local Storage

IndexTier stores your tier list locally in your browser using `localStorage`.

- Your data is private
- Clearing browser data will remove saved lists
- Export your list as JSON if you want a backup

---

## Running Locally

You don’t need anything fancy.

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a browser  
   *(or serve it locally if you prefer)*

That’s it.

## Why IndexTier?

Most tier list tools are:
- Overdesigned
- Account-locked
- Ad-heavy
- Or break when you upload more than one image

IndexTier focuses on:
- Stability
- Simplicity
- Control

It’s a workspace, not a social platform.
