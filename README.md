Local Storage

IndexTier stores your tier list locally in your browser using localStorage.

Your data is private

Clearing browser data will remove saved lists

You don’t need anything fancy.

Download or clone the repository

Open index.html in a browser
(or serve it locally if you prefer)

That’s it.

Why IndexTier?

Most tier list tools are:

Overdesigned

Account-locked

Ad-heavy

Or break when you upload more than one image

IndexTier focuses on:

Stability

Simplicity

Control

It’s a workspace, not a social platform.
